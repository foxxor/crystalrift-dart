## What is working?

* Character movement in 4 directions. (W,A,S,D)
* Camera following main character.
* Character collission detection.
* Pushable elements.
* Buildings, characters, items and decorations are loaded dinamically using json files.
* Map tilesets, each tile can have a different graphic and collision rule.
* Character to character interaction. (Enter)
* Actions handling. (On-screen text, framed-animations)
* Particle effects like fire, poison, smoke.
* Text boxes for long texts. (Enter to skip)
* Basic particles and animations.
* Character pathfinding.
* Very basic action battle system.

## Additional Utils in the repository

* Tile selector utility, click on any tile of the tileset to retrieve the x,y coordinates.
* Initial version of the map editor.

### TO-DO

* ~~Camera movement with main character~~ Buggy!
* Different maps handling
* Character special actions (Jump, teleport, flip?)

* Finish the map editor.
* Fix bugs of the map editor.
